## Backend Timer:

I just had the idea to make a timer that runs on a server! So I'll make both versions, but today, I'll aim for the srver version.

1. Create a Var for Dev int input (minutes)
2. Create the functions that will convert that input into seconds.
3. Create an intreval function that counts down.
4. Install and use Nodemon to log the time.
5. I decided to install audio-player and audio-loader, so I can run an audio file upon the timer going off.
6. I also downloaded Temporal date/time lib so I can log the true time along side the countdown.
7. I made my files as modular and user friendly as possible so the user can only focus on 1 page of inputs (Terminal_Timer.js).
